About OpenWorkouts

What is it?
-----------

The idea behind OpenWorkouts is to provide an open source tool everybody can
use to keep track of workouts, in the form of a web-based application.

This includes:

- Multi-user support, allowing users to signup with an account and then
  log in and out.

- Create workouts manually, providing info such as workout day, duration,
  distance, speed, elevation, etc

- Create workouts by uploading "tracking files", like gpx_ or ANT_ fit_ files

- View workouts on a date-based interface

- View details of each workout

- View a profile page for each user with the user workouts, statistics, etc

- Tools to analize, compare and interact with workouts

- Tools to share workouts between users, manage club/group workouts and events

- and many more...

If you are familiar with online services like strava_, `garmin connect`_, etc
the idea of this project is to provide a similar solution, but in a package
you can install locally in your computer or a server of your own.
